# Q-Less
College Project in 2nd Year
This Project is step towards solving one of the problems faced by customers in department stored/Malls ques.
The initial aim was to develop a program so that customers could self-checkout instead of relying on an employee to make the process faster. Though far from reaching that goal the project did accomplish the following objectives:

•	Created A Database for the Managers/Employee to manage the stock.
•	Created a SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) generator for managing and tracking stock.
•	Added a functionality to suggest the customers shortest path from entrance to all the   departments the must visit (as per their shopping list) to exit.
•	Basic self-checkout by adding the SKU code of object in program they want to buy to calculate bill and update stock.
